# Optimal-Location-Framework-for-Electric-Vehicle-Charging-Stations
## Introduction  
As a result of transportation inequities caused by high transit costs, Seattle has proposed Electric Vehicle Charging with Right-of-Way (EVCROW) (Seattle Department of Transportation, 2023), which allows electric vehicle (EV) charging stations to be installed at curbside locations where public right-of-way is adequate to meet the requirements of the pilot program.   
This study aims to use the location model of the Maximum Coverage Location Problem (MCLP) to set the bus station as a potential facility for electric vehicle charging and construct a demand model consisting of the centroid of the census, the centroid of the annual average working day traffic flow, and pois. Optimize site selection. Because the bus station has a good transportation infrastructure, its transformation can pro mote the construction of a shared mobility hub and promote a comprehensive solution to the last mile problem.
